### Pay for the ring, not for the app that is not even that good
Oura ring paywalls the data behind a subscription, but luckily you can export your data from Oura and import it to Cracked Oura.

**Cracked Oura** is an open-source desktop application that provides full access to your health metrics, stored locally on your machine.

**Key Benefits**
- **No Subscription:** See all of your Oura ring data without subscription. 
- **Privacy First:** Your data is stored locally in an SQLite database. It never leaves your computer unless you export it.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Visualize trends, correlations, and deeper insights than the standard app provides.

### AI Health Analyst
Oura's own AI advisor is quite limited. It does not have access to your historical data and cannot answer questions about your health trends, because it has only a few days of data available. 

Cracked Oura can leverage local LLMs to analyze your health data and provide insights. 

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is still experimental, not documented, and under development and will be improved in the future.
